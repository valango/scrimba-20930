# Weekly Web Dev Challenge #1

This project includes a some standard components (testing, etc.) not part
of the [original challenge](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/zlukn92690tnh562dncz/3oh8pqqvtkhdwpg62wsr/aHR0cHM6Ly9zY3JpbWJhLmNvbS9zY3JpbS9jbzcxZjRiZTdiOGE2N2JjODQ4NjY0YjNlP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj13ZWVrbHl3ZWJkZXZjaGFsbGVuZ2U=).

However, the contents of `/src` is the actual project.

This was an interesting stuff to do, because I don't consider myself a front-end guy at all.

Implementing just showing an emoticon took minutes, but
fiddling around with animations was a discovery trip for more than a hour. ;)
